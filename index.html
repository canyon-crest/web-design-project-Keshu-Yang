    <h3>About myself</h3>
<p id="p1"><img src="images/cca.jpg" id="pic1" class="enter">I am Keshu Yang, a junior at <span class="highlight">Canyon Crest Academy</span>. I am taking three classes this semester and serving as a TA for one period. The classes I am taking are <a href="https://sites.google.com/sduhsd.net/mrshaymath/calc-3-and-linear-algebra/syllabus-and-course-info?authuser=0t" target="blank">Calc III</a>, <span class="greentext">AP Physics 1, and AP CSP</span>. I am getting straight As in the first quarter, and I hope I will get As in the next quarter as well. I like the classes I am taking, especially CSP, which is very fun, and I enjoy learning things about us that are based on computers. And I look forward to learning more about things around me in the future.</p>

<h3>My hobbies</h3>
<p id="p2"><img src="images/swimming.jpg" id="pic2" class="enter">I like to <span class="highlight">play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton" target="blank">badminton</a>, play video games, and swim</span> in my free time. I usually play badminton with my friends on weekends and enjoy the fun this sport brings me. I am also on the school badminton varsity team, which makes me very proud of myself. Playing video games is another way I spend time with my friends when we want to take a break from schoolwork. Swimming is a way for me to <span class="greentext">relax and take a break from the trivial things</span>. Sometimes I also play chess to enjoy this fun competition in “brainpower”.</p>

<h3>My family</h3>
<p id="p3"><img src="images/movie theater.jpg" class="enter">There are four people in my family: <span class="highlight">my father, my mother, my sister, and me</span>. My sister, who is 12 years old and a 7th grader, is 4 years younger than me. On weekends, we like to watch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films" target="blank"> movies</a> and enjoy our family time together. On holidays, we would dress up and invite other friends to our home to have dinner with us. We would <span class="greentext">have fun activities</span> such as playing card games that liven up the atmosphere, making everyone smile on their faces.</p>
